# Social Network Analytics

Welcome to the Social Network Analytics! This project is a personal exploration of setting up comprehensive analytics for a hypothetical social network startup consisting of two large pieces: feed and messenger.  
Through a series of hands-on steps, I've dived into various analytical techniques and tools to gain insights and drive data-informed decisions.

Datasets, access to the tools, and expert guidance have been generously provided by the team at Karpov.Courses (https://karpov.courses/).

## Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to simulate the end-to-end process of setting up analytics for a social network startup.  
I've taken on different roles — analyst, data engineer, and more — to create a full-fledged analytics ecosystem.

## Major Steps

### 1. Unveiling the Story

- Explored the distribution of product metrics and performed time series decomposition to uncover hidden patterns.
  
### 2. Crafting Dynamic Dashboards

- Created interactive dashboards using Apache Superset to visualize key product metrics and trends.

### 3. Retention Analysis: Decoding User Behavior

- Delved into user cohorts to understand and visualize user retention dynamics.

### 4. A/B Testing: Experimenting with Recommendations

- Formulated hypotheses and designed A/B tests to evaluate the impact of novel recommendation algorithms.
- Utilized statistical methods like t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, bootstrap, and bucket transformations.

### 5. Marketing Insights: Causal Impact Analysis

- Employed Google's Causal Impact tool to assess the causal effect of marketing campaigns.

### 6. Predicting User Engagement

- Utilized Uber's Orbit Python library to forecast user activity, providing insights for future server capacity planning.

### 7. Automating Insights Delivery

- Engineered ETL pipelines using Apache Airflow and established automated report delivery via messengers.

### 8. Staying Alert to Anomalies

- Implemented a real-time anomaly detection system that triggers alerts upon detecting anomalies.

## Skills Cultivated

- Mastered Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries.
- Honed SQL querying skills for comprehensive data exploration and analysis.
- Developed a deep understanding of A/B testing methodologies and statistical analysis.
- Gained hands-on experience with predictive analytics tools like Google's Causal Impact and Uber's Orbit package.
